# Medicare CVM Claims Analysis (2016–2018)
**Course:** BIA 810 – Advanced Healthcare Analytics  
**Student:** Ehtesham Qureshi  

This project analyzes Medicare claims data to understand trends in Cardiovascular & Metabolic (CVM) services from 2016–2018.

### Key Questions Answered
1. How did CVM claim share evolve vs total Medicare claims?
2. How to segment HCPs based on CVM claim volume?
3. How does CVM burden vary by patient age group?

### Methods Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- HCPCS code filtering for CVM conditions
- HCP segmentation (1 claim, Trialists, Rising Stars, High-Volume)
- Age cohort analysis (18-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+)

### Summary Insights
✅ CVM claim share increased YoY (~15.6% → ~16.6%)  
✅ High-volume HCPs are few but high-impact → field sales priority  
✅ CVM burden is highest in 60+ → marketing should target senior care & comorbidity mgmt
